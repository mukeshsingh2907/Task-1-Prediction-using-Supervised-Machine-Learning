     Task #1: Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning:
              >In this task,we have to predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based on the number of hours they studied.
               This task involves two variables.
               For that we will be using one of the fundamental statistical and machine learning technique which is Simple Linear Regression.
               Linear regression uses the relationship between the data-points to draw a straight line through all them.
               This line can be used to predict future values.
